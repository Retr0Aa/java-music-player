# java-music-player
Music Player that is made in Java for my programming homework.

### Current Features

- Playlist Manager (Create, Delete)
- Song Library
- Custom Songs Folder Selection
- Songs Metadata Viewer (Name, Artist, Album, Genre)
- Basic Player (Play, Pause, Stop)

The player is fundamental and in an early version. Not that it may contain bugs and many features are not yet implemented.
